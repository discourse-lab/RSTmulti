		<segment id="1" parent="2" relname="preparation">I will be brief,</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="54" relname="span">but in response to my colleague from the Russian Federation, I would like to say just a few things.</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="33" relname="span">First, the United States has constantly called for de-escalation and urged restraint.</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="3" relname="e-elaboration">That has been our consistent policy.</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="32" relname="conjunction">Our consistent statements have made clear that military force is not the answer,</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="32" relname="conjunction">and we have commended the Ukrainians, frankly, for enduring more than probably any country in the United Nations could or would endure without using force.</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="34" relname="summary">Therefore, there have been no shortage of efforts at diplomacy.</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="9" relname="antithesis">Secondly, it is not the United States that has escalated the situation,</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="37" relname="span">it is the Russian Federation.</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="40" relname="concession">Thirdly, while we would like to place our faith in talks with the Russian Federation, the European Union and Ukraine,</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="38" relname="span">it is hard to reconcile the behaviour of the Russian Federation, the propaganda of the Russian Federation and the military actions of the Russian Federation</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="11" relname="e-elaboration">- which range from the massing of 40,000 troops on the border to the subversive activities inside Ukraine -</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="42" relname="span">with their appeal for diplomacy and de-escalation.</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="13" relname="e-elaboration">It is an appeal that we wish were in fact sincere.</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="16" relname="circumstance">Fourthly, a few times,</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="45" relname="span">the representative of the Russian Federation has described</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="43" relname="span">what is happening in the eastern cities as protests and demonstrations.</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="19" relname="attribution">I would refer back to my French colleague's comment</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="44" relname="span">that those claims are rooted in some idea that the Internet does not exist and that people cannot see for themselves that they are not protests and they are not demonstrations.</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="46" relname="span">They are professional forces carrying weapons</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="20" relname="e-elaboration">- Russian-made weapons, as it happens -</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="47" relname="sameunit">and carrying out sophisticated, coordinated military operations across a substantial number of eastern Ukrainian cities.</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="48" relname="list">They are not demonstrations.</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="48" relname="list">They are not protests.</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="48" relname="list">They are military operations.</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="27" relname="concession">Finally, the credibility of the Russian Federation has been gravely undermined.</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="57" relname="span">That said, we remain eager and willing to talk about how to de-escalate the situation.</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="58" relname="list">That will require that the Russian Federation pull back its forces, which are ominously stationed and massed at the eastern Ukrainian border.</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="58" relname="list">It will require that the Russian Federation work to de-escalate the situation in the light of the armed takeover of those buildings.</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="31" relname="condition">If, in fact, the Russian Federation is interested in peace and in upholding its role as an enforcer of international peace and security,</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="59" relname="span">then it will engage quickly and with a wholly different degree of conviction, urgency and truthfulness than it has up to this point.</segment>
