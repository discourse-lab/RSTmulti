		<segment id="1" parent="27" relname="span">First, Egypt supports the call of the Secretary-General to strengthen the role of women in peacekeeping activities, mediation and the prevention of conflicts.</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="1" relname="evidence">That call was supported by the three major reviews carried out recently in that area.</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="28" relname="span">We have also seen tangible evidence of the importance of the role of women in their countries,</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="3" relname="elaboration">especially in Liberia, Malawi and Central Africa, where women are successfully governing.</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="31" relname="evidence">Second, there are large gaps in terms of the Council's resolutions and their follow-up.</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="31" relname="span">We therefore need to adopt a methodology</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="6" relname="e-elaboration">that will enable us to bridge those gaps so as to ensure the comprehensive implementation of those resolutions.</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="33" relname="conjunction">We also need to step up the role of the Informal Experts Group set up in resolution 2242 (2015).</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="36" relname="span">Third, several questions continue to be absent from our debate,</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="9" relname="background">such as the suffering of women who are living under foreign occupation.</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="35" relname="span">I point out also the exaggeration of the link with human rights and international humanitarian law,</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="11" relname="circumstance">because it weakens the means for providing available protection in times of peace as well as in times of war.</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="35" relname="restatement">I reiterate that there is the problem of politicizing some of the issues linked to the two regimes of international law that I have mentioned.</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="41" relname="conjunction">There are also problems with regard to the infringement of national sovereignty,</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="41" relname="conjunction">and sometimes we rely on information that is unofficial and lacking precision.</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="40" relname="span">That distracts our attention from the issues that concern us, to their detriment,</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="16" relname="e-elaboration">in particular the participation of women in conflict prevention and resolution.</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="49" relname="list">Fourth, problems and weaknesses persist with regard to the appointment of women to senior level and leadership posts in political missions.</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="20" relname="cause">Fifth, our programme of action completely fails to take into account cultural particularities in its implementation,</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="44" relname="span">which negatively affects the participation of women in conflict prevention and resolution.</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="22" relname="condition">Sixth, it is important that discussions continue within the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations,</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="45" relname="span">so that we can confront the challenges and problems standing in the way of the full participation of women in peacekeeping activities.</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="24" relname="evaluation-N">Seventh, Egypt is about to adopt a strategy on gender equality,</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="47" relname="span">and we very much welcome the statement made by Ambassador Macharia Kamau earlier,</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="46" relname="span">since the strategy to be adopted by the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations can be an excellent starting point for bolstering the participation of women in conflict prevention and resolution,</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="25" relname="elaboration">particularly in terms of action at the regional level.</segment>
