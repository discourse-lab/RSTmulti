		<segment id="1" parent="41" relname="list">Several issues were raised by our Russian colleague.</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="41" relname="list">I would like to answer just one.</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="42" relname="span">(spoke in Russian) First, Mr. Churkin compared the situation in December and January with the current situation.</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="32" relname="conjunction">We must recall that, at that time, the people were speaking out against the banditry of the authorities,</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="32" relname="conjunction">and now it is bandits who are against the people.</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="42" relname="elaboration">There is a difference there.</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="44" relname="span">We cannot remain calm about the fact that several hundred separatists are holding thousands of people hostage to fear in towns.</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="7" relname="elaboration">We see the standoffs on television in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Dnipropetrovsk.</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="45" relname="span">We cannot look on while small groups of armed people, headed up, inter alia, by agents from the Russian Federation, seize State buildings and take weapons to hand out.</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="9" relname="elaboration">Indeed, those are terrorist operations that have been specially organized and orchestrated.</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="40" relname="span">Mr. Churkin is absolutely right,</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="39" relname="span">there is not much time left at all,</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="12" relname="elaboration">there is just about an hour and a half.</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="48" relname="concession">It is just as easy for him to call his President and say a few simple things to him</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="48" relname="span">as it is for me to do so,</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="15" relname="purpose">so I will repeat them here.</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="38" relname="conjunction">The statement that Mr. Churkin has referred very negatively to several times today was made by the acting President, Mr. Turchynov,</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="38" relname="conjunction">and was addressed to those people who are now creating tension in those towns, the terrorist groups of separatists.</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="20" relname="attribution">He stated: (spoke in English)</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="37" relname="span">"Those not involved in shooting at Ukrainian law enforcement officers and who will surrender their weapons and leave State administrative buildings will be released from prosecution."</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="50" relname="span">(spoke in Russian) Why do they not call their people and tell them to come back, sit down around the negotiating table and decide together how we can establish good neighbourly relations?</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="21" relname="elaboration">That would be the right thing to do.</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="24" relname="attribution">The Government mentioned</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="33" relname="span">the referendum, changes to the Constitution, the retention of the language law and the fact that the problems that have cropped up over the decades and remained unsolved by previous Governments needed to be addressed at last.</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="26" relname="concession">That is something that we need to do,</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="34" relname="span">but we are being prevented from doing so.</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="53" relname="solutionhood">I would like Mr. Churkin to listen to that and convey what he can to his Government.</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="36" relname="list">(spoke in English) I am sincerely thankful to the members of the Security Council who spoke in favour of a peaceful resolution of the problems in Ukraine.</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="36" relname="list">I am sincerely thankful for that.</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="35" relname="conjunction">I also thank the members of the Security Council for understanding the critical situation in Ukraine</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="35" relname="conjunction">and for any kind of support they can provide.</segment>
