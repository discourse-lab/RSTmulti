# RSTmulti

Dataset and scripts for RSTmulti

Repository to accompany the The 19th Linguistic Annotation Workshop (LAW 2025) paper: [Disagreements in analyses of rhetorical text structure: A new dataset and first analyses](https://aclanthology.org/)

## Data

Our doubly annotated data can be found in the `data/` folder.

The files beginning with `maz-*` are from [PCC*](https://github.com/mohamadi-sara20/pcc/tree/main/double-annotated), with more information in the paper: [Discourse Parsing for German with new RST Corpora](https://aclanthology.org/2024.konvens-main.7/) (Shahmohammadi & Stede, KONVENS 2024).

The files beginning with `pcc-*` as well as `impfenpro.rs3` and `olympiacon.rs3` were doubly-annotated for the LAW paper. More information on the orignal PCC corpus can be found [here](https://angcl.ling.uni-potsdam.de/resources/pcc.html).

The files beginning with `UNSC-*` are previously unpublished doubly-annotated files from the UNSC-RST corpus. More information can be found in the paper: [Rhetorical Strategies in the UN Security Council: Rhetorical Structure Theory and Conflicts](https://aclanthology.org/2024.sigdial-1.2/) (Zaczynska & Stede, SIGDIAL 2024), as well as in the repository for the [UP Multilayer UNSC Corpus](https://github.com/discourse-lab/UMUC/tree/main).

The other files (which end with either `-a2`, `-b1`, or `-or`), are previously unpublished [APA-RST](https://github.com/fhewett/apa-rst) files. More information can be found in the paper: [APA-RST: A Text Simplification Corpus with RST Annotations](https://aclanthology.org/2023.codi-1.23/) (Hewett, CODI 2023).
